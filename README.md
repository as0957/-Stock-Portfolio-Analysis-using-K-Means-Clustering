## Introduction

This project explores K-Means clustering to analyze historical data of a single stock, aiming to identify underlying patterns and characteristics within its behavior over time.

## Data

The analysis uses the "Stock Portfolio - Financial Risk Analytics" dataset from Kaggle, focusing on relevant features like adjusted closing price and volume.

## Methodology

The methodology involves:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and potentially scaling numerical features.
- **Feature Selection:** Choosing relevant features for clustering.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Grouping data points into clusters based on their similarity.
- **Cluster Analysis:** Examining the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into the stock's behavior.

## Results

Run the provided code (details on running and interpreting the results will be provided within the code). This code generates a plot visualizing the clusters based on the chosen features. You can modify the code to input different stock names and adjust the number of clusters (k) for further analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the application of K-Means clustering to identify patterns and characteristics within historical stock data. By analyzing the clusters, we gained insights into the stock's potential behavior under different market conditions.
